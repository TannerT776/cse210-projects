# Foundation 4 — C# Final Project

This repository contains four small C# console applications designed to demonstrate the core principles of Programming with Classes:

1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

Each program runs independently and contains classes, methods, and objects that fulfill the design requirements.

### Features

- Store title, author, length, and comments
- Display video details and comments
